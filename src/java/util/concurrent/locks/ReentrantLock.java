/**
 * A reentrant mutual exclusion {@link Lock} with the same basic
 * behavior and semantics as the implicit monitor lock accessed using
 * {@code synchronized} methods and statements, but with extended
 * capabilities.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ReentrantLock} is <em>owned</em> by the thread last
 * successfully locking, but not yet unlocking it. A thread invoking
 * {@code lock} will return, successfully acquiring the lock, when
 * the lock is not owned by another thread. The method will return
 * immediately if the current thread already owns the lock. This can
 * be checked using methods {@link #isHeldByCurrentThread}, and {@link
 * #getHoldCount}.
 *
 * <p>The constructor for this class accepts an optional
 * <em>fairness</em> parameter.  When set {@code true}, under
 * contention, locks favor granting access to the longest-waiting
 * thread.  Otherwise this lock does not guarantee any particular
 * access order.  Programs using fair locks accessed by many threads
 * may display lower overall throughput (i.e., are slower; often much
 * slower) than those using the default setting, but have smaller
 * variances in times to obtain locks and guarantee lack of
 * starvation. Note however, that fairness of locks does not guarantee
 * fairness of thread scheduling. Thus, one of many threads using a
 * fair lock may obtain it multiple times in succession while other
 * active threads are not progressing and not currently holding the
 * lock.
 * Also note that the untimed {@link #tryLock()} method does not
 * honor the fairness setting. It will succeed if the lock
 * is available even if other threads are waiting.
 *
 * <p>It is recommended practice to <em>always</em> immediately
 * follow a call to {@code lock} with a {@code try} block, most
 * typically in a before/after construction such as:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class X {
 *   private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
 *   // ...
 *
 *   public void m() {
 *     lock.lock();  // block until condition holds
 *     try {
 *       // ... method body
 *     } finally {
 *       lock.unlock()
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>In addition to implementing the {@link Lock} interface, this
 * class defines a number of {@code public} and {@code protected}
 * methods for inspecting the state of the lock.  Some of these
 * methods are only useful for instrumentation and monitoring.
 *
 * <p>Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
 * locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
 * its state when serialized.
 *
 * <p>This lock supports a maximum of 2147483647 recursive locks by
 * the same thread. Attempts to exceed this limit result in
 * {@link Error} throws from locking methods.

ReentrantLock可重入锁是Lock接口最为典型的一个实现类
独占锁，即同一时刻，只能有一个线程持有锁
可重入，持有锁的线程可再次获得锁，而无需等待
提供公平锁、非公平锁两种模式，默认为非公平锁。对于公平锁，ReentrantLock保证先请求获取锁的线程，一定先获得锁，即“先到先得”

    公平锁：多个线程按照申请锁的顺序去获得锁，线程会直接进入队列去排队，永远都是队列的第一位才能得到锁。
        优点：所有的线程都能得到资源，不会饿死在队列中。
        缺点：吞吐量会下降很多，队列里面除了第一个线程，其他的线程都会阻塞，cpu唤醒阻塞线程的开销会很大。

    非公平锁：多个线程去获取锁的时候，会直接去尝试获取，获取不到，再去进入等待队列，如果能获取到，就直接获取到锁。
        优点：可以减少CPU唤醒线程的开销，整体的吞吐效率会高点，CPU也不必取唤醒所有线程，会减少唤起线程的数量。
        缺点：你们可能也发现了，这样可能导致队列中间的线程一直获取不到锁或者长时间获取不到锁，导致饿死。

 */
    /*
    通过lock接口获取锁，大体上可以分为以下三种情况：
        1）锁空闲，加锁并将持有锁的计数(state)加1。
        2）锁被当前线程持有（重入），将持有锁的计数加一。
        3）锁被其它线程持有，则阻塞当前线程直至获取到锁，然后将持有锁的计数设置为一。

     * <p>The hold count information is typically only used for testing and

     * <p>Analogous to the {@link Thread#holdsLock(Object)} method for

     * debugging and testing. For example, a method that should only be
